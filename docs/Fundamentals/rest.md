## **Brief intro**
REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer.

It means when a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource.

## **Principles of REST:**

- [x] Client-Server
- [x] Uniform interface:
    * Resource identification
    * Resource Manipulation using representations
    * Self-descriptive messages
    * Hypermedia as the engine of application state
- [x] Cacheable
