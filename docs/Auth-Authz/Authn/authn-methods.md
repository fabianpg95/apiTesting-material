The below explained are the best practices of REST API Authentication methods.

## **Basic Authentication**
HTTP Basic Authentication isn't suggested because of its inherent security vulnerabilities.

This technique doesn't need cookies, session IDs, login pages, and alternative such specialty solutions.

```
curl "https://example.com/" \
-H "Authorization: Basic bXlVczNybkBtZTpteVA0c3N3MHJk"
```

**Bearer Authentication**

The bearer token permits access to a precise resource or universal resource locator and presumably could be a cryptic string, sometimes generated by the server in response to a login request.

```
Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IlE1QVdrc1dIVmEiLCJ0eXAiOiJKV1QifQ.eyJwaWQiOiJ1cy13ZXN0LTI6ZmQ3NGQ1ZmItNGMzMS00OWYyLWIwNDUtMjVjNmRiMWNiN2IzIiwidWlkIjoiWm1RM05HUTFabUl0TkdNek1TMDBPV1WFhNjEtYjRjZjI0MGQ0ZDFlIiwiaWF0IjoxNjU4NjEzMTE4fQ.FegjkNUl9eiDBFH4tm5Z9jKSLwyR2x_TEi16BBQj_axHaC52CaCseSeShqy485bzoNFnxdNR616u_fih_Lp5q25JFHpZxrWdyP4rxxpjXxdr_ErMlb...
```

## **API-Keys**

* This method normally has an expiration date.

* The problem with this method is that gives access to all operations which API can do (CRUD).

* API keys identify projects, not users.

## **OAuth (2.0)**

OAuth2 combines Authentication and Authorization to permit additional subtle scope and is designed to grant access to resources set like:

* remote API
* user's data

The previous versions of this specification, OAuth 1.0 and 1.0a, were far more difficult than OAuth 2.0

#### **OpenID Connect**

OpenID Connect is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which allows computing clients to verify the identity of an end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the end-user in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

## **How to Select the Right API Authentication Method**

Selecting the authentication method that is best for a particular API comes down to the level of security thatâ€™s required to validate clients versus the ease of implementation and maintenance.
