## **CORS**
### **Shared info between servers**
When a web page is opened, loading data from third-party servers is, in theory, strictly prohibited. 

However, there may be exceptions: if the administrators of both websites have agreed to work together, there is no reason to avoid sharing. In these cases, so-called c*ross-origin resource sharing (CORS)* regulates the collaboration.
